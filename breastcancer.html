         <h1 id="t2">How can one detect breast cancer early?</h1>
            <p>The most important screening test to detect breast cancer early is the mammogram. 
                A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. 
                It can detect breast cancer long before a tumor might be felt by you or your provider. 
                We follow guidelines set by 
                the American College of Radiology and 
                the American Society of Breast Surgeons and recommend that average-risk 
                women age 40 and older receive annual mammograms. Women at higher risk should be screened earlier.</p>
