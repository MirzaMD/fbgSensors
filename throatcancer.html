         <h1 id="t1">What is throat cancer?</h1>
            <p>Throat cancer is the general term for cancer that affects one or more parts of your throat. Usually, people who have throat cancer have cancer in their larynx (voice box) or their oropharynx (the middle part of their throat). Healthcare providers typically use surgery to treat throat cancer. The specific surgery depends on the type of throat cancer, location and whether it has spread.</p>

             <h1 id="t1">What are the throat cancer types?</h1>
                <pre>
                    <b>Hypopharyngeal cancer:</b> This cancer affects the part of your throat that’s just above your esophagus and windpipe.

                    <b>Nasopharyngeal cancer:</b> This is a rare type of throat cancer.
                                            It affects the part of your throat that’s just behind your nose.

                     <b>Supraglottic cancer:</b> This cancer starts in the upper part of your larynx.
                     It can affect your epiglottis, the cartilage that keeps food from going into your windpipe.
                    About 35% of all laryngeal cancers start in your supraglottis.

                    <b>Glottic cancer:</b>This is cancer in your vocal cords. 
                    Your vocal cords are in the middle part of your larynx. 
                    More than half of all laryngeal cancers start here.
                    
                    <b>Subglottic cancer:</b>This cancer starts below your vocal cords in the lower part of your voice box. 
                    About 5% of all laryngeal cancers start here.</pre>
