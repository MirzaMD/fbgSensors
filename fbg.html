        Key Points:<br>
        <strong>Challenges in Traditional Cancer Detection:</strong> Current methods like mammography, MRI, and biopsies are often invasive, expensive, or limited in sensitivity. Thereâ€™s a need for non-invasive, cost-effective tools for early cancer detection.<br><br>
        
        <strong>FBG Sensors for Medical Applications:</strong> FBG sensors, being fiberoptic-based, offer intelligent sensing capabilities. They can measure vital parameters like body temperature and blood pressure, which are essential for identifying early symptoms of diseases, including cancer.<br><br>
      
        <strong>Thermal Sensitivity in Cancer Cells:</strong> Tumor cells often exhibit higher temperatures due to faster metabolic rates and increased blood flow. FBG sensors can be used as thermal sensors to detect these temperature changes with high precision, which is critical for early cancer detection, especially for cancers like breast cancer.<br><br>
      
        <strong>Advantages of FBG Sensors:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Immune to electromagnetic interference.</li>
          <li>Low power consumption.</li>
          <li>Ability to be multiplexed into sensor networks.</li>
          <li>Non-invasive and real-time data provision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Despite their promise, FBG sensors face issues such as a low signal-to-noise ratio, cross-sensitivity, and environmental interference. Optimization of the Q-factor is crucial for their performance in cancer detection.<br><br>
      
        <strong>Images:</strong> To visualize FBG sensors and their applications in cancer detection, you could search for images such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Fiber Bragg Grating sensors in medical use.</li>
          <li>Schematic representation of FBG sensor arrays for thermal detection in tissues.</li>
          <li>Comparison images of normal vs. cancerous tissue thermal readings using FBG sensors.</li>
